# CineMatch - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Product Vision

**CineMatch** is a movie discovery platform that helps film enthusiasts find their next favorite movie through personalized recommendations, curated collections, and comprehensive movie information.

### Our Solution:

CineMatch provides a focused, delightful movie discovery experience that:
